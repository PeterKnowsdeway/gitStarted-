				<h1> This is a bit about myself</h1>
				<p> Hi everyone, my name is Peter Welter. I am 19 years old and originally from Crystal Lake Illinois about 1 hour outside of Chicago Illinois. I moved to Bolivar Missouri about 3 years ago with my parents to start living on a farm and redo a 50-year-old home which we are just about finishing up.I have two older siters Shara, and Cassise. Shara is married and just had her first littile girl and Cassie is hopefully getting married soon. </p>
		
		
				<h2> My Hobbies</h2>
				<p>My hobbies range from many things such as playing golf, model rocket building, model trains, playing video games, playing piano, sketching, and I love to compose music with orchestra samples, and making patches for analog synthesizer such as the Yamaha CS-80 and Moog System-55  </p>

				<h3> What I did over the summer</h3>
				<p> Most of what I did over the summer was rather boring since it was mostly working around the farm. However, the bright moment was seeing my favorite baseball team the Chicago Cubs play the Kanssas City Royals where it felt like the Cubs were playing at home due to the amount of cub fans that showed up. It was an amazing experience and there was even a Go Cubs Go chant after the game that lasted about 15 min.</p>
